  <h2><em>How We Started</em></h2>
  <p>We started this website because we love shoes and we wanted to be able to share that passion with others. We also wanted to watch out for the consumer and let them know how two guys who have actually worn the shoes feel about them.</p>

<h2><em>Why Trust Us?</em></h2>
<p>We are two fellas that have worn many a shoe. Instead of the reviews that are bought and paid for on the websites themselves, come here to get a first take from your fellow average man</p>
